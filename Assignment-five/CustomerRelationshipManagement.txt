PROJECT REPORT

Customer Relationship Management

1. Introduction

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a system used by organizations to manage 
customer information, sales activities, and customer support. A CRM system helps 
improve customer satisfaction and business performance.

Agile methodology is a modern software development approach that focuses on flexibility,
continuous feedback, and incremental development. Using Agile for CRM development allows
faster delivery and easy adaptation to changing customer needs.

2. Objective of the Project

The objectives of this mini-project are:

   -> To manage customer data efficiently

   -> To track sales and customer interactions

   -> To improve customer support services

   -> To develop CRM software using Agile methodology

3. Problem Statement

Many organizations face difficulties such as poor customer data management, slow 
response to customer queries, and inflexible software systems. Traditional development 
methods cannot quickly adapt to changing requirements. Hence, an Agile-based CRM system 
is needed.

4. Proposed System

The proposed system is a CRM application developed using Agile methodology. The system 
is built in small iterations (sprints), allowing continuous improvement based on user 
feedback. Each sprint delivers a working part of the CRM system.

5. Agile Methodology

Agile is an iterative development approach where software is developed in small cycles 
called sprints.
