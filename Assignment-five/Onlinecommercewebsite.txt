PROJECT REPORT

Online E-Commerce Website 

1. Introduction

E-commerce (Electronic Commerce) refers to buying and selling goods and services over 
the internet. An online e-commerce website allows customers to browse products, place 
orders, make online payments, and track deliveries from anywhere and at any time.

With rapidly changing customer requirements and market trends, traditional software 
development methods are not flexible enough. Agile methodology provides a better 
approach by allowing incremental development, continuous feedback, and faster delivery 
of features.
This project focuses on developing an Online E-Commerce Website using Agile methodology 
to ensure flexibility, quality, and customer satisfaction.

2. Objectives of the Project

    -> The main objectives of this project are:

    -> To design an online platform for buying and selling products

    -> To provide easy product search and secure online payment

    -> To manage users, orders, and products efficiently

    -> To develop the system using Agile methodology

    -> To allow continuous improvements based on user feedback

3. Problem Statement

Traditional shopping systems require physical presence and are time-consuming. Many 
existing online systems are difficult to update and do not adapt quickly to customer 
needs. Changes in pricing, offers, or features take time to implement.

Hence, there is a need for a flexible and scalable e-commerce website developed using 
Agile methodology that can quickly respond to changing requirements.

4. Proposed System

The proposed system is a web-based online e-commerce website developed using Agile 
methodology. The project is divided into small development cycles called sprints, where 
each sprint delivers working features such as product listing, cart management, or 
payment processing.

User feedback is collected at the end of every sprint and used to improve the system in 
future iterations.

5. Agile Methodology

Agile is an iterative and incremental software development approach. Instead of developing 
the entire system at once, Agile focuses on delivering small, functional parts of the 
system regularly.

 -> Key Features of Agile:

Customer collaboration

    -> Incremental development

    -> Continuous testing

    -> Quick response to change

6. Agile Development Process

    -> Requirement Gathering – User stories are collected

    -> Product Backlog – List of features such as login, cart, payment

    -> Sprint Planning – Features selected for each sprint

    -> Sprint Development – Coding and testing

    -> Sprint Review & Retrospective – Feedback and improvement

7. System Architecture

    -> The e-commerce system follows a three-tier architecture:

    -> Presentation Layer: User interface (web pages)

    -> Business Logic Layer: Order processing, cart management

    -> Database Layer: Stores user, product, and order data

8. System Modules

8.1 User Management

    -> User registration and login

    -> Profile management

8.2 Product Management

    -> Add and update product details

    -> Product categories and pricing

8.3 Shopping Cart

    -> Add or remove products

    -> View cart summary

8.4 Order Management

    -> Place orders

    -> Track order status

8.5 Payment Module

    -> Online payment processing

    -> Order confirmation

8.6 Admin Module

    -> Manage products and users

    -> View sales reports

9. Tools and Technologies Used

    -> Programming Language: Java / Python

    -> Framework: Spring Boot / Django

    -> Database: MySQL

    -> Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

    -> Agile Tools: Jira / Trello

    -> Version Control: Git

10. Advantages of Agile-Based E-Commerce System

    -> Faster feature delivery

    -> Easy modification of features

    -> Improved customer satisfaction

    -> Reduced development risk

11. Limitations

    -> Requires continuous customer involvement

    -> Initial cost and time estimation is difficult

    -> Needs experienced Agile team members

12. Future Enhancements

    -> Mobile application support

    -> AI-based product recommendations

    -> Real-time order tracking

    -> Integration with multiple payment gateways

13. Conclusion

The Online E-Commerce Website developed using Agile methodology provides a flexible, 
scalable, and user-friendly solution for online shopping. Agile helps deliver high-quality
software through continuous feedback and regular improvements. This project demonstrates 
how Agile methodology improves the development and maintenance of modern e-commerce systems.
