PROJECT REPORT

Automated Banking Website Using Agile Methodology

1. Introduction

An Automated Banking Website is an online system that allows customers to perform banking 
operations such as checking account balance, transferring money, paying bills, and viewing 
transaction history without visiting a bank branch.

With the growth of digital banking, customers expect secure, fast, and easy-to-use 
online services. Agile methodology is suitable for developing an automated banking 
system because it supports continuous improvement, quick updates, and regular feedback 
from users.

This project focuses on developing an Automated Banking Website using Agile methodology 
to provide secure, reliable, and user-friendly banking services.

2. Objectives of the Project

 -> The main objectives of this project are:

    -> To automate basic banking operations

    -> To provide secure online banking services

    -> To reduce manual work and paperwork

    -> To improve customer convenience and satisfaction

    -> To develop the system using Agile methodology

3. Problem Statement

Traditional banking systems require customers to visit branches for many services, which 
is time-consuming. Existing systems are often slow to update and difficult to modify 
when requirements change.

Therefore, there is a need for a flexible and secure automated banking website developed 
using Agile methodology to meet changing customer needs efficiently.

4. Proposed System

The proposed system is a web-based Automated Banking Website developed using Agile methodology. 
The system is developed in small iterations called sprints, where each sprint delivers 
working banking features such as login, balance enquiry, or fund transfer.

User feedback is collected after every sprint and used to improve the system in the next 
iteration.

5. Agile Methodology

Agile is an iterative and incremental software development approach that focuses on 
delivering working software quickly and continuously.

 -> Key Features of Agile:

    -> Customer collaboration

    -> Incremental development

    -> Continuous testing

    -> Quick response to requirement changes

6. Agile Development Process

    -> Requirement Gathering – Banking features are identified as user stories

    -> Product Backlog – List of features like login, transfer, transaction history

    -> Sprint Planning – Selection of features for each sprint

    -> Sprint Execution – Development and testing

    -> Sprint Review & Retrospective – Feedback and improvements

7. System Architecture

    -> The Automated Banking Website follows a three-tier architecture:

    -> Presentation Layer: Web interface for users

    -> Business Logic Layer: Banking operations and validation

    -> Database Layer: Stores customer and transaction data

8. System Modules

 -> 8.1 User Authentication

    -> Secure login and logout

    -> Password encryption

 -> 8.2 Account Management

    -> View account details

    -> Balance enquiry

 -> 8.3 Fund Transfer

    -> Transfer money between accounts

    -> Transaction confirmation

 -> 8.4 Transaction History

    -> View previous transactions

    -> Download statements

 -> 8.5 Bill Payment

    -> Pay utility bills online

 -> 8.6 Admin Module

    -> Manage users and accounts

    -> Monitor transactions

9. Tools and Technologies Used

    -> Programming Language: Java / Python

Framework: Spring Boot / Django

    -> Database: MySQL

    -> Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

    -> Agile Tools: Jira / Trello

    -> Version Control: Git

10. Advantages of Agile-Based Banking System

    -> Faster feature delivery

    -> High system security

    -> Easy system enhancement

    -> Better customer experience

    -> Reduced operational cost

11. Limitations

    -> Requires continuous user feedback

    -> Initial planning is less detailed

    -> Depends on skilled Agile team

12. Future Enhancements

    -> Mobile banking application

    -> Biometric authentication

    -> AI-based fraud detection

    -> Integration with digital wallets

13. Conclusion

The Automated Banking Website developed using Agile methodology provides a secure, 
flexible, and efficient solution for modern banking needs. Agile enables continuous 
improvement, faster delivery, and better adaptation to changing requirements. This 
project demonstrates how Agile methodology improves the development of reliable banking 
systems.
