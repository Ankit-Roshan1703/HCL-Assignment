PROJECT REPORT

Healthcare Management System Using Agile Methodology

1. Introduction

A Healthcare Management System is a software application designed to manage healthcare
related activities such as patient records, appointments, doctor information, billing, 
and medical history. It helps hospitals and clinics improve efficiency, accuracy, and 
quality of patient care.

Healthcare requirements often change due to new regulations, medical practices, and 
patient needs. Agile methodology is well suited for healthcare system development 
because it supports flexibility, continuous improvement, and regular feedback from users 
such as doctors, staff, and administrators.

This project focuses on developing a Healthcare Management System using Agile methodology 
to provide a secure, reliable, and user-friendly healthcare solution.

2. Objectives of the Project

    -> The main objectives of this project are:

    -> To manage patient records digitally

    -> To automate appointment scheduling

    -> To improve communication between patients and healthcare staff

    -> To ensure data accuracy and security

    -> To develop the system using Agile methodology

3. Problem Statement

Traditional healthcare systems rely heavily on manual processes and paperwork, which 
leads to data loss, errors, and delays in patient care. Existing systems are often 
difficult to update and do not adapt quickly to new healthcare requirements.

Hence, there is a need for a flexible and scalable Healthcare Management System 
developed using Agile methodology.

4. Proposed System

The proposed system is a web-based Healthcare Management System developed using Agile 
methodology. The system is divided into small development cycles called sprints, where 
each sprint delivers working healthcare features such as patient registration or 
appointment booking.

Continuous feedback from users is collected after each sprint to improve the system in 
future iterations.

5. Agile Methodology

Agile is an iterative and incremental software development approach that focuses on 
delivering working software in small releases.

 -> Key Features of Agile:

    -> Continuous user involvement

    -> Incremental development

    -> Frequent testing

    -> Quick response to changing requirements

6. Agile Development Process

    -> Requirement Gathering – Healthcare requirements are written as user stories

    -> Product Backlog – List of features such as patient records, appointments, billing

    -> Sprint Planning – Selection of features for each sprint

    -> Sprint Development – Design, coding, and testing

    -> Sprint Review & Retrospective – Feedback and process improvement

7. System Architecture

    -> The Healthcare Management System follows a three-tier architecture:

    -> Presentation Layer: Web interface for patients and staff

    -> Business Logic Layer: Healthcare operations and validation

    -> Database Layer: Stores patient, doctor, and medical data

8. System Modules

 -> 8.1 Patient Management

    -> Patient registration

    -> Maintain medical history

 -> 8.2 Doctor Management

    -> Doctor profile management

    -> Schedule management

 -> 8.3 Appointment Management

    -> Book and cancel appointments

    -> Appointment reminders

 -> 8.4 Medical Records

    -> Diagnosis and treatment records

    -> Prescription management

 -> 8.5 Billing and Payments

    -> Generate bills

    -> Payment tracking

 -> 8.6 Admin Module

    -> Manage users and system data
 
    -> Generate reports

9. Tools and Technologies Used

    -> Programming Language: Java / Python

    -> Framework: Spring Boot / Django

    -> Database: MySQL

    -> Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

    -> Agile Tools: Jira / Trello

    -> Version Control: Git

10. Advantages of Agile-Based Healthcare System

    -> Faster development and deployment

    -> Easy adaptation to new requirements

    -> Improved system quality

    -> Better patient care and satisfaction

11. Limitations

    -> Requires continuous feedback from healthcare staff

    -> Initial project planning is less detailed

    -> Needs skilled Agile development team

12. Future Enhancements

    -> Mobile healthcare application

    -> Telemedicine and video consultation

    -> AI-based disease prediction

    -> Integration with wearable health devices

13. Conclusion

The Healthcare Management System developed using Agile methodology provides an efficient, 
flexible, and secure solution for modern healthcare needs. Agile enables continuous improvement, 
faster feature delivery, and better alignment with user requirements. This project demonstrates 
how Agile methodology enhances healthcare software development.
